Each of the questions in this questionnaire contains six responses. Read each response carefully and decide which ones fit you to some degree. Then, of those responses that fit you, rank them in order of your preference. Mark the response that best fits you as your first choice, the response that fits you second best as your second choice, the response that fits you third best as your third choice, and so on. You will notice that you can select only five of the six responses. Note: You do NOT have to rank every choice. If a response does not fit you at all, do not select it. As a result, for some questions, you might select only one response and, for others, you might select two, three, four or five response - as many as you believe fit you to some degree.
